eZ Tags extension will create a couple of demo tags for you so you can see it in action.

For it to work, you will have to do the following:

1. Edit the Article class and add a new Tags attribute. Set the identifier of the new attribute to eztags

2. Edit one of your Article objects and add one of the predefined tags or create your own and add them to object

3. Publish the object and view it on the frontend

You should see the list of tags attached to the object just below the body of the article.
